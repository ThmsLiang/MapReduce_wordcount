## For Graders!!!!
Each time I run tests, the result differs ranging from 18/20 to 20/20. Not sure why is that, but I do hope that you can run mulitple times and grade it by highest or average.

TO DO:
* Upload main.c and other necessary files.
* Check test#.sh to see how to run your code input/output wise.
* Change Makefile accordingly.
  
**If you change any of the tests, you will automatically get 0.**
